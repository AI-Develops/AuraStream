# Project: AuraStream Minimalist Soundboard

## Objective
Build a fully functional, single-file web application (`index.html`) that acts
as an ambient sound mixer. The design should be "Zen" (minimalist, clean,
calm colors).

## Requirements

### 1. Audio Logic
- Provide UI controls (toggles and volume sliders) for at least 4 sound types:
  - Rain
  - Coffee Shop
  - Forest
  - White Noise
- Use public domain placeholder audio URLs (e.g., from Pixabay or
  Wikimedia Commons).
- Sounds must loop seamlessly.
- Audio should be handled via the HTML5 Audio API.

### 2. UI/UX Features
- **Visuals:** Use a dark-mode-first aesthetic with soft transitions.
- **Master Control:** A "Stop All" button to instantly silence the app.
- **Visual Feedback:** CSS animations or simple progress bars that move when
  a sound is active.
- **Responsive:** Ensure the layout shifts from a grid on desktop to a
  vertical list on mobile.

### 3. Technical Constraints
- All CSS and JavaScript must be embedded within the `index.html` file.
- Do not use external libraries or frameworks (No React, No Tailwind).
- Use CSS Variables for the color palette to allow easy customization.
- JavaScript should use a clean, modular structure.

### 4. Output Specification
- **Final Output:** Generate a single, production-ready `index.html` file.
